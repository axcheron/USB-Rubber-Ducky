# USB Rubber Ducky

The USB Rubber Ducky is a Human Interface Device programmable with a simple scripting language allowing penetration testers to quickly and easily craft and deploy security auditing payloads that mimic human keyboard input. The source is written in C and requires the AVR Studio 5 IDE from atmel.com/avrstudio. Hardware is commercially available at hakshop.com. Tools and payloads can be found at usbrubberducky.com.
